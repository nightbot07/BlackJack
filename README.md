1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to outline the design and structure of the Blackjack game, including class design, relationships, and implementation details.

1.2 Scope
This project is a simple command-line Blackjack game where a player competes against the dealer. The game follows standard Blackjack rules, including hitting, standing, and busting.

2. Git Repository Information
2.1 Repository URL
GitHub Repository: [Insert GitHub Repo URL]

2.2 Cloning the Repository
To clone the repository, run the following command:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone [Insert Repo URL]
2.3 Branching Strategy
main - Stable production-ready code
develop - Active development branch
feature/* - Feature-specific branches
bugfix/* - Bug fixes
3. System Overview
3.1 Features
Deck of 52 cards (4 suits, values assigned based on rank)
Player can hit (draw a card) or stand (end turn)
Dealer follows a fixed strategy (hits until value ‚â• 17)
Win/loss/tie conditions
Ace handling (11 or 1 based on hand value)
4. Design Considerations
4.1 Assumptions
Only one player versus dealer
No betting system included
Game runs in a terminal
4.2 Constraints
Implemented in Java
No GUI, only text-based interaction
5. Class Design
5.1 Class Diagram Summary
The system is structured using four primary classes:

Card - Represents a playing card (suit, rank, value).
Deck - Stores and shuffles cards, provides methods to deal cards.
Hand - Manages cards in a hand and calculates hand value.
BlackjackGame - Controls game flow, player turns, and game rules.
5.2 Class Responsibilities
Card Class
Attributes: suit, rank, value
Methods: getValue(), toString()
Deck Class
Attributes: cards (ArrayList of Card)
Methods: shuffle(), dealCard()
Hand Class
Attributes: cards (ArrayList of Card)
Methods: addCard(), calculateValue(), isBusted()
BlackjackGame Class
Attributes: deck, playerHand, dealerHand
Methods: startGame(), playerTurn(), dealerTurn(), showResult()
6. Sequence Diagram
Describe the flow of game execution step-by-step.

Game starts - Deck is shuffled, hands are dealt.
Player's turn - Player chooses to "Hit" or "Stand".
Dealer's turn - Dealer plays according to rules.
Determine result - Compare hand values and display the winner.
7. Implementation Plan
Task	Description	Status
Set up GitHub repo	Initialize repo, add .gitignore	‚úÖ Done
Implement Card class	Create suit, rank, value attributes	‚úÖ Done
Implement Deck class	Create deck, shuffle, deal cards	‚úÖ Done
Implement Hand class	Add cards, calculate hand value	‚úÖ Done
Implement BlackjackGame class	Game logic, player/dealer turns	üîÑ In Progress
Testing	Ensure rules function correctly	‚è≥ Pending
8. Testing Strategy
Unit Testing: Test Card, Deck, and Hand independently.
Integration Testing: Ensure BlackjackGame correctly executes game logic.
9. Conclusion
This document outlines the design and development approach for the Blackjack game. The Git repository will be used for version control, and further improvements will be made based on testing feedback.

Would you like me to add anything else, such as user stories or additional diagrams? üöÄ
